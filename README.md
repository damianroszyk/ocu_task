# Oculyze

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.
State management is simplified here for clarity ( in next version there will be NgRx )
Pages are not fully responsive now.
There are only 2 unit tests: one for component and one for the service call just to showcase usage.
Structure is not completed, should be refactorized and optimized in future versions.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
